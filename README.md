# Homework_Week_1

The object of this homework assignment was to refactor Horiseon's website to make it accessible. Using Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh's Web Accessibilty Guidelines, I reviewed the existing code and added alt text to all of the images that appear on the site. I also changed the names of some of the div classes to meet accessibity guidelines.

Once the HTMl file had been updated, I went into the CSS and consolidated the classes and IDs. I also added comments to indicate what each piece of CSS controlled and commented out the changes that I made.
